TODO
----

* Use DBUtils_, especially SolidConnection.

.. _DBUtils: http://www.webwareforpython.org/DBUtils

* ``_fromDatabase`` currently doesn't support IDs that don't fit into
  the normal naming scheme.  It should do so.  You can still use
  ``_idName`` with ``_fromDatabase``.

* More databases supported.  There has been interest and some work in
  the progress for Oracle. IWBN to have Informix and DB2 drivers.

* Better transaction support -- right now you can use transactions
  for the database, but the object isn't transaction-aware, so
  non-database persistence won't be able to be rolled back.

* Optimistic locking and other techniques to handle concurrency.

* Profile of SQLObject performance, so that I can identify bottlenecks.

* Increase hooks with FormEncode validation and form generation package, so
  SQLObject classes (read: schemas) can be published for editing more
  directly and easily.  (First step: get Schema-generating method into
  sqlmeta class)

* Automatic joins in select queries.

* More kinds of joins, and more powerful join results (closer to how
  `select` works).

* Refactor ``DBConnection`` to use parameterized queries instead of
  generating query strings.

* A hierarchy of exceptions. SQLObject should translate exceptions from
  low-level drivers to a consistent set of high-level exceptions.

* Merge SQLObject.create*, .create*SQL methods with DBPI.create* methods.

* Made SQLObject unicode-based instead of just unicode-aware. All internal
  processing should be done with unicode strings, conversion to/from ascii
  strings should happen for non-unicode DB API drivers.
