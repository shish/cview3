TODO:

  + wait for libpq to become really thread safe w.r.t. the use of the
    crypt() function and reenable threads around PQconnectdb.
 
  + finish documentation, both psycopg-specific and dbapi.

  + write more regression tests.

  + finish dbapi-2.0 testsuite.

  + how to cope with time zones? postgres include tz information in results, 
    so, how should we use it?

  + profile and optimize

  + do a commit when switching back from autocommit (better transaction level
    management, really.)

DONE:

  + add database management from inside zope (not done, but i am
    rapidly loosing interest in zope. patches welcome...)

  + replace all the '-1' (ignored) values in TABLE_DESCRIPTIONS with 
    meaningfull values. Will be done while moving testsuite out of
    psycopg.

  + make tuples static where possible (A: not possible in a multithreaded
    environment!)
  
  + add tests to test suite, check for BINARY (has postgres a binary type?) 
    and for ROWID (moving testsuite 'paco' in its own package).

  + convert mxDateTime to DateTime in ZPsycopgDA.

  + add exceptions to curs_closeall(), curs_commitall(), curs_rollbackall()
    [added asserts].

  + add missing types to the builting type objects.

  + write macros to autogenerate types from postgresql headers.
 
  + add autocommit.
