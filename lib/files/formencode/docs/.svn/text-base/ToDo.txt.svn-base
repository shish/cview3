* Make a test fixture for validators, to make testing really easy.

* Consider moving htmlfill to ElementTree or another DOM-ish
  structure, instead of HTMLParser.  Or re-implement with another
  parser but same interface.

* Generate Javascript for validators, for client-side validation (when
  possible).

* Relatedly, test and give recipes for Ajax-ish validation, when fully
  client-side validation doesn't work.

* Better tests for ``htmlfill`` and ``htmlfill_schemabuilder``.

* Create a ``RequireIfNotEmpty`` form validator, when one field is
  only required when another is filled in.

* Include at least one good documented form generator.  Consider
  including rich widgets (Javascript).

* Figure out what the role of ``htmlform`` is.

* Seperate out ``doctest_xml_compare``, maybe (useful in any doctested
  web test).

* Make ``doctest_xml_compare`` work with wildcards/ellipses.  Maybe
  with non-XHTML.

* Maybe include `wareweb.packing
  <http://pythonpaste.org/wareweb/module-wareweb.packing.html>`_,
  which is kind like like one-way validation for really small forms.
  A compliment/alternative to `variabledecode
  <module-formencode.variabledecode.html>`_.

* Some more ways to build validation.  Validation from docstrings or
  method signatures.
