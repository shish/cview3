Many thanks to all you psycopg users for the bugreports and success 
stories. And in particular to:
 
    Andrè Schubert, for the incredible determination in crashing psycopg
	in any possible way.

    Yuri Don, for using psycopg in some strange environments that we don't
        have time to test in (cyrillic? what's cyrillic?!) and for providing
	the date parsing patch.

    Bill Anderson (for the report) and Ivo van der Wijk (for the patch) about
        Zope INSTANCE_HOME problems in ZPsycopgDA.

    Philip J. Mayers, for the problems about sql quoting.

    Alex, for pointing out the Zope DateTime problems.

    Scott Leerssen, for crashing psycopg and sending a crash script,
        crucial in finding a whole lot of refcounting-related bugs (i will
        definitely move to a language with a real gc sometimes... elastiC.)
    
    Jack Moffitt, for testing psycopg in production environment and
        continuously reporting bugs, without switching to another product. :)

    Stuart Bishop and the others who tested psycopg under MacOS X.

    Paul Zwart for converting people to psycopg!

    Chris Kratz, for providing a patch to the Zope concurrent update problem.

    Leonardo Rochael Almeida, bugreports and fixes (thanks!)

    Mario Lorenz, for the psychotic and cryptic password problem.	
    
    Matt Hoskins, Tom Jenkins and Jelle for sending in patches.
 
And all the others that I left out only because I didn't find any references
on the mailing list archives.
