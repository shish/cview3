Download SQLObject
++++++++++++++++++

The latest releases are always available on the `Python Cheese Shop
<http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/SQLObject>`_, and is installable
with `easy_install
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_.

You can install the latest release with::

  easy_install -U SQLObject

You can install the latest version of SQLObject with::

  easy_install SQLObject==dev

You can install the latest bug fixing branch with::

  easy_install SQLObject==bugfix

If you want to require a specific revision (because, for instance, you
need a bugfix that hasn't appeared in a release), you can put this in
your `setuptools
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_ using
``setup.py`` file::

  setup(...
    install_requires=["SQLObject==bugfix,>=0.7.1dev-r1485"],
  )

This says that you *need* revision 1485 or higher.  But it also says
that you can aquire the "bugfix" version to try to get that.  In fact,
when you install ``SQLObject==bugfix`` you will be installing a
specific version, and "bugfix" is just a kind of label for a way of
acquiring the version (it points to a branch in the repository).
