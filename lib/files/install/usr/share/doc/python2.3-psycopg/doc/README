The files in this directory are the skeleton of two guides: a generic
DBAPI 2.0 programming guide and the psycopg guide. They are both work
in progress, but the exmaples in the examples/ directory are up to
date and perfectly working.

The guides have been moved to their own archive. Look for 
dbapi20programming in the same place where you found this archive.
